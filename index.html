            <h2><a href="split/">Split</a></h2>
            <p>Takes a sequence of frame numbers to split up a video, similar in
                concept to using the razor tool in Adobe Premiere. This is especially
                useful for applying filters to specific sections of a video or in
                cases where the parameters may vary in different parts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Join - should be selected if the video is to be kept whole
                    for exporting. If not selected, the output will be a bunch
                    of commented out clips to be exported individually.</li>
                <li>Still images - check to keep only the individual frames specified.
                    Useful for creating a bunch of screen capture images at once.</li>
                <li>Add crop(0,0,0,0) - as implied, this adds .crop(0,0,0,0) to
                    the end of each clip. This is handy for older video sources
                    (especially analog sources) with black borders on the sides
                    that varies in size. Note that when joining clips they must
                    all have the same dimensions, so it may be necessary to add
                    a resizer after cropping.</li>
            </ul>
